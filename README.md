# Steganography
Secure Data Hiding In Images Using Steganography

I have created a program for steganography using a simple and basic code .
The primary objectives of this project are:
1) To implement a simple and efficient image steganography technique for hiding textual data.
2) To ensure that the visual quality of the image remains unchanged after embedding the data.
3) To provide a method for extracting the hidden information from the image.
4) To analyze the effectiveness and limitations of the chosen technique in terms of security and robustness.
